these are the states through which a transaction may pass. 

Initially a transaction is in 'passive state' and when the transaction's execution begins it is in 'active state'.

CPU has 'ALU' but it cannot perform operations directly using HD because of speed factor , CPU operates in million operations per second whereas HD operates very slow , and that's why we have a very fast memory type in between them which is 'RAM'.

- The 'Active State' means that transaction is loaded in RAM from HD and CPU is executing it.
- The 'Partially Committed State' means that all operations in a transaction is successfully executed only 'COMMIT' is left to be executed. Changes are present in local memory (RAM) only and not made in the HD.
- The next state can be 'Failed State' or 'Committed State'
	- 'Failed State' occurs when ACID properties checks not satisfied / system shut's down, due to which transaction failure occurs leading to 'Failed State'. After which 'ROLLBACK' is being made leading to 'Aborted State' and finally 'Terminated State'.
	- When ACID properties checks are satisfied, after which 'permanent' change is being made in HD. Leading to transaction being successful and final 'Terminated State'.
- 'Termination' means deallocation of resources.
- Also after 'Failed State' the transaction cannot get started from the same point ... resource manager will come ... the transaction is then sent to aborted state --> termination after which it can be 'RESTARTED' again in future.


> [!NOTE] NOTE :
> There can be Cache Memory instead of RAM, which is much faster than RAM and in cache as well there are different levels like L1, L2, L3.
