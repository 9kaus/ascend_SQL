# ACID properties

--> They are not visible directly on implementation level. They are more of a phenomena which are design level practices.

They are to followed in the Back-End SERVER DB related programming.

## Atomicity

If one of operation fails before commit then 'ROLLBACK' and NO COMMIT because the transaction has failed.

Atomicity means - Either all or None - Either all operations gets successfully executed then only COMMIT otherwise ROLLBACK because that is transactional failure.

A failed transaction cannot be resumed, it gets restarted from the very first operation.

> NOTE :<br>
> Before COMMIT every operation is performed and stored in RAM only, After COMMIT changes are made in DB server HD.

## Consistency

Consistency checks are done before completion of transactions so that the changes which will come to effect after 'COMMIT' adhere to database/column constraints (predefined business rules).

example :- banking DBs, gambling game DBs, etc.

## Isolation

Isolation means that two different transactions are kept isolated by making them execute serial wise (one after another) and not parallelly.

Q. Does it stop context switching ?

For instance, if Transaction T1 updates a row, Transaction T2 must wait until T1 commits or rolls back. Isolation prevents T2 from reading unreliable data updated by T1 but not committed yet.


## Durability

Durability provides persistence guarantees for committed transactions. The system upholds the changes once a transaction is committed even if it crashes later. Durability is achieved with database backups, transaction logs, and disk storage.

For example, if a transaction updates a customer's address, durability ensures the updated address is not lost due to a hard disk failure or power outage. The change will persist with the help of storage devices, backups, and logs.

Durability ensures that transactions, once committed, will survive permanently. Failed hardware, power loss, and even database crashes will not undo committed transactions due to durability support.

# Write Ahead Logs

Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) is a **technique used in storage systems** to ensure the durability and consistency of transactions.

- The basic idea behind WAL is to **record changes in a log before they are applied to the actual storage**.
- This log, often referred to as the write-ahead log, contains a sequential record of all changes made to the database.
- **Transactions are not considered complete** until the corresponding changes are safely recorded in the write-ahead log.

### How Write-Ahead Logging typically works ?

1. **Add operation details to log file:**
2. **Actual Data Modification to in Memory store**
3. **Commit transaction**
4. **Checkpointing**
5. **Recover if needed**
